# Important information:
This project is in "beta", this means that this project isn't complete/working fully. EFI built for Sequoia with Intel wifi support.

Note: I recommend switching out the nVme drive for a different one (Factory installed SSD isn't supported by Opencore) or installing it on a SSD. 
- Also for Intel Wi-Fi/Bluetooth to work it its required to install from OCLP Root Patches. 
- If you have an outdated BIOS, please upgrade it to the latest version available (Currently available version for this device is: DKCN55WW)
